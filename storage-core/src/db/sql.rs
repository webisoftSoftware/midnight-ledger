//! An implementation of `super::DB` backed by an SQLite database.
//!
//! Because our needs are very simple, we use the bare-bones `rusqlite` crate,
//! instead of something fancier like `diesel` (a full-on ORM, which seems like
//! overkill) or `sqlx` (a db agnostic, async-first SQL toolkit, but claimed to
//! be "7-70x slower" than `rusqlite` and `diesel`).
//!
//! We need to implement a mapping from `ArenaHash` hashes to `OnDiskObject {
//! data: Vec<u8>, ref_count: u32, children: Vec<ArenaHash> }`. For simplicity,
//! we use a single table `node`, with the hash keys as primary ids, and store the
//! vector of children hashes as a serialized binary blob. Alternatively, since
//! the hashes are expected to be 32 bytes, we could probably improve disk usage
//! a little at the expense of slower lookups and more implementation
//! complexity, by introducing a standard integer primary key, and storing the
//! children hashes in a separate 3-column join table of the form `parent id x
//! child id x child index`.
//!
//! We also need to keep track of which hashes are GC roots, and most hashes are
//! not roots, so we have a separate table `root` for that.
//!
//! We serialize hash keys using versioned serialization via
//! [`crate::serialize::Serializable`], but behind the scenes no version information is
//! included for the hash keys, i.e. there is no version overhead from
//! this. However, the serialization format for `ArenaHash` includes the length
//! of the vector, even tho these are always the same size for a given hash
//! function, so we could probably reduce from 36 to 32 bytes per hash using a
//! custom serializer.
//!
//! SQLite write transactions are very expensive, so intensive write operations
//! should always use the `SqlDB::batch_update` when possible. See discussion
//! here: <https://www.sqlite.org/draft/faq.html#q19>. See discussion inside the
//! `all_ops_memory` test for ways to speed up transactions that we didn't
//! enable. A more drastic alternative would be to expose transactions in the
//! API, and let the user create a single transaction for a batch of operations.
//!
//! This module handles concurrency without corruption, but may crash under high
//! concurrent loads, when the busy timeout is exceeded. If someone is
//! experiencing crashes due to high concurrency at some point in the future,
//! first make sure the high load is justified (e.g. should `bulk_insert` be
//! used instead?), and then increase the busy timeout in `SqlDB::new`.
