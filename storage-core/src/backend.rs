/// A storage back-end, that wraps interactions with the database and provides

///
/// # Overview
///
/// This module intermediates between the in-memory arena and the persistent
/// database, managing reference counts for the Merkle-ized DAGs we store in the
/// DB, and providing a caching layer. The cache addresses several concerns:
///
/// 1) reducing disk reads: by keeping data read from the on-disk DB in memory,
///    we can avoid going to disk again the next time that data is accessed.
///
/// 2) reducing disk writes: the arena creates a lot of *temporary* data
///    structures that will never be persisted -- i.e. be marked as a gc-root or
///    be in the transitive closure of a GC root -- and so instead of eagerly
///    writing these data to disk, we keep them in memory in case they get
///    dropped right away. Also, we track reference counts in the DB, and so by
///    doing reference count updates only in cache where possible, we avoid
///    having to write intermediate states to disk.
///
/// 3) bulking disk writes: transactions in SQLite (used by
///    [`crate::db::SqlDB`]) are very expensive, and so we want to do many
///    writes at once when possible. By collecting the potential writes in
///    memory in the cache, we can then flush them periodically en masse.
///
/// However, this caching layer also adds complexity, because we now have
/// multiple potential sources of truth, the DB and the cache. The main
/// complexity here arises from concern (2), reducing disk writes. We optimize
/// the common case, where the arena creates temporary data structures and
/// [`StorageBackend::cache`]s them into the cache, only to drop them soon
/// after. The tricky thing here is deducing that the net change of a bunch of
/// arena cache mutations is the identity, i.e. that we don't need to write
/// anything to the DB. In the case of new object creation -- meaning objects
/// that aren't already in the DB -- this is easy: when the arena announces it's
/// done with a particular key -- by calling [`StorageBackend::uncache`] on that
/// key -- we simply check if that key has any remaining references to it, and
/// drop it if not. The harder case is when the arena changes the reference
/// counts for keys that already exist in the DB, by creating larger structures
/// that reference these existing keys. To handle this case, we track reference
/// count deltas instead of cardinal reference counts: if the net effect of all
/// the deltas is zero, then we know the key can safely be dropped from the
/// cache.
///
/// Another source of complexity arises from a concern that has nothing to do
/// with the goals of caching, and instead conflicts with caching: we want to
/// support the creation of data structures that are too large to fit in memory,
/// without the user needing to carefully checkpoint the construction. To deal
/// with this, we track the size of the write cache, and provide
/// [`StorageBackend::flush_cache_evictions_to_db`] to bulk-write mutations to disk
/// when the write cache has become too large. In these cases we can't know at the time
/// of disk-writing if the written mutations will persist. So, we may end up
/// with unused temporary values in the DB, and a separate GC operation is
/// responsible for cleaning these up periodically.
///
/// # Assumptions
///
/// - the database is not changing under our feet, meaning in particular that
///   there is only one back-end. When an object `obj` is `cache`d into the
///   back-end, what happens depends on whether `obj` is already in the
///   database. To support the database changing under our feet, we would need
///   to handle the case where `obj` was in the database when it was `cache`d,
///   but was then removed from or modified in the database by another thread
///   before `obj` was `uncache`d.
///
/// - there is only one "logical" arena calling into / manipulating the
///   back-end. Here "one logical arena" includes multiple clones of a single
///   initial arena, since cloned arenas share their metadata structures and
///   avoid `cache`ing the same object more than once. Indeed, the key
///   assumption we make here is that no object will be `cache`ed more than
///   once, independently. It would be possibly to support multiple, distinct
///   arenas -- non-clones, with distinct metadata -- manipulating the back-end,
///   but would require more careful tracking of `cache` calls, to handle the case
///   where two different arenas `cache` the same object, and we need to be
///   careful to keep it around until all these arena's are done using it.
///
/// - objects are `cache`d only after all of their children have been `cache`d
///   or are already in the db. In particular, this means the arena is
///   responsible for sanitizing user controlled inputs before passing them to
///   the back-end, to make sure they are well formed, in terms of children
///   references.
///
/// - if the caller `cache`s an object `obj`, and wants
///   `obj` to continue to exist in the back-end, then before `uncache`ing `obj`,
///   the user needs to first do either of:
///
///   - `cache` but not `uncache` another object which has `obj` in its
///     transitive closure.
///
///   - `persist` an object that has `obj` in its transitive closure.
///
///   Note that it's okay for the caller to e.g. `uncache` interior nodes of a
///   large data structure, as long as a reference to the root has been
///   `persist`ed or `cache`d-but-not-`uncache`d.
///
/// # Terminology and APIs
///
/// A key will never be in `read_cache` and `write_cache` at the same time, but
/// may be in `database` and either cache at the same time. If a key is in
/// either cache, then we say it's "in memory". If a key is in memory, then the
/// value stored in memory under that key describes the canonical version of the
/// object.
///
/// The back-end provides various public APIs related to manipulating in-memory
/// representations of objects. The `get` API brings an object into memory from
/// the database. The `cache` API attempts to create a new object in memory,
/// but falls back on any existing version already in memory or the DB. The
/// `uncache` API informs the back-end that an object is no longer of interest to
/// the caller, which allows the back-end to remove it from memory if it has no
/// references or pending updates in memory. These APIs act on `ArenaHash` keys
/// and `OnDiskObject` values, but internally manipulate more complex states, in
/// the form of `CacheValue` values.

    // We could batch load the `unreachable_keys` nodes
    // from the db, altho it's unclear what the size bound should be here in
    // relation to the read cache size, since we need to bring in their children
    // as well (which could be a second bulk pass), and so we'd probably need
    // some idea of the average number of children of a typical node.
    //
    // Alternatively, and much more generally, we could eliminate most concerns
    // about bulk fetching and deleting from the db here (and elsewhere!) by
    // instead exposing a db transaction interface. Then we would just start a
    // write transaction at the beginning of gc, and commit it at the end. To
    // get the same performance as the existing db batch operations we need to
    // also cache prepared statements (I have no idea how much these buy us or
    // if this caching would be worth the trouble).
    //
    // # Alternative implementation: time bounded, incremental
    //
    // The current implementation does a full gc, cleaning up as much as
    // possible. However, since the backend is unusable while gc is running, we
    // might instead prefer a time bounded, incremental version. To get a time
    // bounded version, assuming we have enough time to calculate the full
